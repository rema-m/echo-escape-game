# Echo Escape

An escape room game where you navigate through darkness using sound waves.

## Game Overview

In Echo Escape, you find yourself trapped in a dark maze. Your only way to see your surroundings is by emitting echo pings that temporarily reveal the environment and objects around you. Your goal is to escape by finding keys, opening chests, discovering terminal codes, and solving puzzles.

## Gameplay Path

1. **Navigate with Echo Pings**: Press SPACE to emit an echo ping that reveals your surroundings temporarily.
2. **Find the Small Key**: Look for the small key to open the first chest.
3. **Open the First Chest**: Use the small key to open the first chest and find a document.
4. **Find the Second Chest**: Use the document to open the second chest and find a tool.
5. **Find the Third Chest**: Use the tool to open the third chest and find the large key.
6. **Find Terminal Codes**: Search for code puzzles that reveal codes for the terminals.
7. **Solve the Terminals**: Use the codes to solve the three terminals:
   - Terminal 1: Requires code "2048"
   - Terminal 2: Requires code "ECHO" and the document
   - Terminal 3: Requires code "NEURAL" and the large key
8. **Find the Exit**: Once all terminals are solved, a green exit will appear. Reach it to escape!
